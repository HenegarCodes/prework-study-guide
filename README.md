# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


Creating this project was just the beginning of the software development journey I am on. This prework study guide has helped me learn new concepts and reinfe old ones. While learning I have gained trust in myself and knowledge to pass on to others. Building this has given me more motivation to continue and keep honing in on my educational journey that has been software development. I genuinly enjoy creating items and solving problems. This problem solves me having to conitnously go back and forth to google if I forget simple items that are the basics of a language or how to operate in terminal. This way whenI get into an actual software position I can excel at doing the basics. I learned a lot of amazing things however operating in the terminal has been the most enjoyable as I had never heard of it or done it at all.
